<p>As you can see, the event binding is slightly different here. Instead of using the click()
      method, I’ve used the on() method with document as the selector. This indicates that I 
      want to monitor changes to the page and perform the event binding that follows any time 
      an element matching the selector (the second argument) is added. The first argument is 
      the name of the event to bind—it’s the name of the event to be bound, placed in quotation marks. The second argument is the selector to match. The third is the event handler 
      as it would normally be written. The on() method is one of the most powerful features of 
      jQuery because it enables you to automatically treat dynamically generated content the 
      same way you’d treat content that’s on the page at the time that it load There are other methods for adding content in different locations in relation to a selected 
      element. For example, if I change the append() call to prepend(), new items will be 
      added to the top of the list rather than the bottom. You can also use the before() method 
      to add content before another element, and the after() element to add it after. The 
      difference is that when you use those methods, the content is placed outside the tags 
      matched by the selector, rather than inside those tags</p>

      <P>XmlHttpRequest to make requests to the server in the background and use the results 
            within the page.
            The Web is based around the concept of pages. When you click a link or submit a form, 
            usually you leave the page that you’re on and go to a new page with a different URL (or 
            refresh the current page). AJAX is about retrieving content from the server and then placing it on the page using JavaScript. 
            The previous example demonstrated how to use JavaScript to process data entered in a 
            form and add it to a page instantly. Using AJAX, you can use the same techniques to 
            retrieve data from the server and add it to the page. It’s possible to write the code necessary to do this sort of thing from scratch, but jQuery makes it a whole lot easier.
            Usually, AJAX is associated with server-side applications. For example, you can create a 
            search engine and then use AJAX to retrieve search results and present them without ever 
            leaving the current page. Unfortunately, there’s not enough space in this book to teach 
            you how to create a search engine. jQuery also provides the ability to retrieve information from a different static page using AJAX and present it in the current page. I’m going 
            to present an example that takes advantage of that feature to show you how AJAX can be 
            used</P>

                  <p>Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country located
                  in the southeastern part of South America. It is home to some 3.5 million people, 
                  of whom 1.4 million live in the capital Montevideo and its metropolitan area. An 
                  estimated 88% of the population are of European descent.</p>
                  <p>Uruguay's only land border is with Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, to the north.
                  To the west lies the Uruguay River, to the southwest lies the estuary of Rio de 
                  la Plata, with Argentina only a short commute across the banks of either of these 
                  bodies of water, while to the southeast lies the southern part of the Atlantic 
                  Ocean. Uruguay, with an area of approximately 176 thousand km2, is the second 
                  smallest nation of South America in area after Suriname.</p>
